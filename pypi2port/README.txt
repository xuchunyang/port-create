Read packages from Python's PIP (pip2port)
The project idea aims at 
generating portfiles for python packages in pip 
that are non-existent in MacPorts. Also, the idea aims to bring 
uniformity to the present system by automating the process of creating 
ports to make package names in Macports match with the ones in pip which 
is presently not applicable for each and every port. This can be 
summarized as - when a user runs a command such as pip2port 
<package- name> it returns the port file for that particular 
python-package.
